# Eccentricities of wide binaries

Here we provide codes and simulated data that are used in Hwang et al. (in prep.). In this paper, we developed a Bayesian method to infer the eccentricity of wide binaries from the v-r angle, the angle between the separation vector and the relative velocity vector.


## binary_sampling

In the file `Demo 1 - Using p(gamma|e) grid.ipynb`, we demonstrate the use of the pre-computed grid data for p(gamma|e), the v-r angle distribution given an eccentricity. The grid data in located in folder "grid_data".
